Need to find how to create cotrollers from the commnad

you might need to update the tool but this is what you can use while creating controllers

dotnet aspnet-codegenerator controller \
    -name LogsController \
    -api \
    -async \
    -m BlazingChat.Server.Models.Log \
    -dc BlazingChat.Server.Models.BlazingChatContext \
    -namespace BlazingChat.Server.Controllers \
    -outDir Controllers

I would also like to show how this could be done from Visual Studio 2019
